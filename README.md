V3rmillion hub is a basic script hub / gui library for roblox. I made it within 3 hours and I do intend to add more things to the library as time goes on, such as sliders and notifications. Currently there is a small problem with dragging the UI, once you click a page button, dragging is disabled. If that occurs then just click the homebutton and you will be able to move the UI while on the homepage. Added keybinds, documentation is coming soon
